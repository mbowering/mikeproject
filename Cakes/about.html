My name is Mike Bowering and I am the author of this website. I have absolutely no baking skills. As a Computer Science major at Gateway Community College and with a background in extreme sports, I wanted to take this oppertunity to appreciate my favorite art, edible art.<p></p>

Family always comes first. My wife Elisa loves to bake. Whether it's a small birthday party with friends or a holiday party with Family, Elisa bakes the most delicious and beautiful desserts. 
<p></p>I decided to design the Capstone project around the idea of a customer in the market for a dessert for a specific event.<p></p>
Coding HTML reminds me of Elisa's baking. From the planning and development stages to the final product, the process is fun.
